        "define": "A <b>MIDI file</b> is a sequence of instructions that allow a synthesizer to produce sound. In other words, it can be thought of as the equivalent of a musical score, but written for specialized programs instead of humans.",
        "limit": "Stemming from this nature, MIDI files are meant to be <i>written</i> by a human, but not <i>used</i> by one, except to feed it directly to a synthesizer. However, there exist <b>MIDI devices</b> which can produce individual synthesizer commands, and which are meant for human use.",
        "solution": "The Midifile Performer, in turn, bridges the gap between these two, and allows you to <b>play back a MIDI file</b> by using a MIDI device."

        "sets": "When uploading a MIDI file to the application, the instructions contained within are grouped together in <b>sets</b> of simultaneous occurrence. These sets come in pairs : <b>on sets</b> are triggered by <b>pressing</b> any button on your MIDI device, and will <b>activate</b> notes ; <b>off sets</b> are triggered by <b>releasing</b> a button, and will <b>stop</b> notes.",
        "playingOn": "Once you press a button and trigger an on set, every note it contains is played by the app’s synthesizer. The notes that are played are <b>independent of the key you pressed</b>, and solely reflect the content of the triggered set ; e.g., you may press an A4 key on a MIDI keyboard, but produce a C major chord).",
        "playingOff": "Releasing the button that triggered the on set, in turn, triggers the off set that was paired with it. By repeating this process, you can then iterate through the file."
      },

      "whatCanDo": {
        "h2": "What can you do with this ?",

        "describe": "Because you control the moment where sets occur, you are free to reinterpret the musical piece originally encoded by the file with the cadence of your choice. As well, because you release off sets in the order of your key releases, you can extend notes beyond their original play time, or alter the articulation of individual notes. Finally, any control parameter such as pitch bend, pedal, or simply the velocity of your keypresses, will be passed along to the output synthesizer and affect the output sound.",
